## Pokemon App  

This is a project for Introduction to Data Science at Middlebury College for Spring 2019. I made a shiny app in R that allows for a search input of
any Pokemon, retrieves it's stats, and uses the geojsonio package in R to create an interactive map game. This repository includes the R script and 
subsequent notes, a csv dataset file, and documentation for publishing the app through shinyapps.io. The app can be viewed in an internet browser 
[here](https://gausedatascience.shinyapps.io/test2/).
